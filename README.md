### Final Project for Code Fellows 201  | Version 1.0.0

Individuals with cognitive issues lack a fun and interactive way to improve their cognitive abilities, so we set out to help them with this issue.

We decided to create a game to improve hand-eye coordination.
The object of the game is to pop balloons of a specified color as they appear on the screen.  As the game progresses, the balloons increase in frequency and quantity.  Points are awarded for each balloon popped and a score will be calculated.  The total score will be displayed in a chart displaying previous players’ scores.
