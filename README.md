### Balloons | Version 2.0

This was originally developed as a final project for Code Fellows 201 by Bryant Davis, Marlene Rinker, Dave Wolfe, & Melissa Galush. 
[Link to original game](https://mgalush.github.io/balloons/)

After the 201 class, I modified the project as practice before 301 started.

In this version:

- the balloons move

- the header components of the game have backgrounds

- the instructions are shorter

- the form inputs are larger

- it knows if you are a returning user (before all users were new users)

- it displays your score and your high score on the results page, along with score of other players who have played the game
